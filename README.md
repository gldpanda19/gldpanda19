- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gldpanda19, but you can call me Garrett.
- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m interested in building data apps for analytics and visualization. I create custom dashboards using tools like MySQL, Python, and Dash (Datapane), but I'm open to learning new tech stacks!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to develop, implement, and optimize machine learning models with Python.
